title = "About"
+++

 I am a person who has many interests, just like any other person, nothing special for sure:)
 Some of them are
 - Long walks, they just relax me(I am a slow walker)
 - Driving(I drive to my gym, which is 400m from home)
 - Cooking(I can cook up a mean Indian curry and lot more)
 - Reading(A sort of new interest I have picked up)
 - Having a good laugh(Who does not like that!)

 I am also a guy working in the IT like many many of the people around, again nothing special. What does make me special are all my experiences and my journey to where I am today.
