Why now? Why did I decide to start a blog post in my mid 30&amp;rsquo;s which for some might be a little late, as I have seen many a folks maintain a blog post since the time of the Y2K and still maintain it to date with hundreds of posts.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://dushyant03.github.io/blogness/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dushyant03.github.io/blogness/about/</guid><description>I am a person who has many interests, just like any other person, nothing special for sure:) Some of them are
Long walks, they just relax me(I am a slow walker) Driving(I drive to my gym, which is 400m from home) Cooking(I can cook up a mean Indian curry and lot more) Reading(A sort of new interest I have picked up) Having a good laugh(Who does not like that!) I am also a guy working in the IT like many many of the people around, again nothing special.</description></item></channel></rss>
