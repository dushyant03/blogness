Why did I decide to start a blog post in my mid 30&rsquo;s which for some might be a little late, as I have seen many a folks maintain a blog post since the time of the Y2K and still maintain it to date with hundreds of posts. Well I think I always wanted to share my thoughts with people and managed to do that only via the usual two way method either over the phone or in person, somehow penning down your thoughts never appealed to me very much at the time, but now something has changed, something in me wants to read and know about experiences/knowledge even more than before and also at the same time be able to share mine. Its almost like how our parents at a certain age would be glued to the news channels and newspapers all the time and seemed tp enjoy it. So I too have to come to realize that amassing knowledge on various topics is something I have started to enjoy and would like to share too, as the very famous quote &ldquo;<em>The more knowledge you share, the more it grows</em>&rdquo;.</p><p>I shall keep this one very short, and just let people who might read the blogs in the future, that I shall try to have a mixture of topics in this blogpost, consisting of topics around tech, personal experiences, or generally topics that I find interesting.</p></article></main></div><footer><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/blogness/img/bundle.min.ae45e7a9a0a65150dd900a58f35fe84d.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=1f676b title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=1f676b><option value=1dbc91></datalist></div></footer></body></html>
