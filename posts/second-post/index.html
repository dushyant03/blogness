Now the question is, does the culture within a team influence the productivity of the team?</p><p>To answer the above question we need to understand, what do you understand by the word Culture? To me Culture in a group setting or withing a team is, the way every member in the team interacts and behaves with each other and how to convey their ideas and opinions within the team. Every member can have a different equation with every other member in the team but there is always a commonality which in turn becomes the culture of that team. To illustrate this in an example. There are 2 teams, one team everyday in their StandUp calls always start with a round of Among Us(The mobile app game) and a bit of chit chat before really getting down to business, on the other hand the second team get down to business as soon as everyone gets on the call, with almost no small talk. This basically sheds a bit of light on what the culture in the team could be.</p><p>Now that we sort of know what team culture means, lets try to find out does it effect the productivity and the ability to get work done faster. Lets again take an example of two teams with different ways of working with each other. Lets call them Team Green and Team Blue. Both teams have a equal number of members, and work in 2 weeks agile sprints, both teams have a healthy mixture of mid senior and senior members and a few new joiners.</p><p>Team Green&rsquo;s standup&rsquo;s are very to the point and with everyone taking turns one by one talking about their work and what they plan to do, but do not like to dwell around pleasantries, like even introducing new joiners, they feel everyone knows who the new joiner is and what they are expected to do. As the sprint progresses, the new joiner has a few questions and reaches out to one of the team members who is also one of the oldest members in the team, now instead of receiving real help, the new joiner asked to read the documentation around the task, which he does but still lacks some context. The next day the new joiner reaches out to the same member again and is asked to find more information online. Not finding much online as well, the new joiner reaches out to another member, and is informed that the information about that task is only with the member who the new joiner had initially approached. Another common scenario in tech teams is, things break, so in team Green one of the team member pushes a faulty code to production and causes a downtime, one of the team member tags the person who made the faulty change and asks them to fix the issue, this is also pointed out in the standup next day and the member who made the change is singled out and asked to be more careful in the future.</p><p>On the other hand, team blue behave very differently. The standup&rsquo;s are more relaxed with members talking about how their day has been and slight amount of small talks and few laughs here and there. They introduce the new joiners with a lot of enthusiasm and make them feel at ease on their first day, and then go on with the regular standup. In the blue&rsquo;s team case when the new joiner reaches out to the oldest team member for help on a task, for which a response is received &ldquo;Lets huddle&rdquo;. On the huddle the senior member walks the new guy through the documentation and helps him understand the task, due to which the new joiner had a clear idea what needed to be done. The other situation where incorrect code is pushed to production, again once issue occurs, various team members reach out and get on a call, trying to fix the issue, the next day a summary of the issue is mentioned and what was done to fix it, with also a round of high fives to the team for fixing the issue swiftly.</p><p>From the above situations that happen in almost all tech teams, and how team Green and Blue work in such situations shows us are, The Blue team creates an environment with cohesiveness, approachability, trust, motivation and collaboration. Where as the Green team mostly fails to work with those qualities, creates a kind of hostile environment with encouraging people to work in silos. In my opinion there are higher chances of team Blue to be more productive as their culture is to take along everyone together and helping each other out to get unblocked, whereas the Green team members can be surrounded by feelings of being stuck not being able to reach out or ask for help.</p><p>So in conclusion the only way forward is to work together as a team, helping everyone who needs it to unblock them. This also is a method we all follow in our lives, we live in communities that help each other out.</p></article></main></div><footer><p>Author: Dushyant Chakravorty</p><div class=req-js><button class=outline-dashed title="Change to light/dark mode."><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="/blogness/img/bundle.min.ae45e7a9a0a65150dd900a58f35fe84d.svg#adjust"/></svg></button><input class=outline-dashed type=color list=presets value=1f676b title="Change accent color." aria-label="Change accent color."><datalist id=presets><option value=1f676b><option value=1dbc91></datalist></div></footer></body></html>
