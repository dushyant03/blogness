        <description>Almost every organization that exists comprises multiple people with different skill sets, and ideally, each of the people with similar skills or different are placed within teams, to work towards a bigger goal, and make their organization do well. Now the question is, does the culture within a team influence the productivity of the team?
To answer the above question we need to understand, what do you understand by the word Culture?</description>

        <description>Welcome to my first blog ever, this is also my first ever attempt at starting something that would let me share my knowledge/experiences with the world or at least with the people I force to read this(my friends, or just my wife or my dog if she could read :D ).
Why now? Why did I decide to start a blog post in my mid 30&amp;rsquo;s which for some might be a little late, as I have seen many a folks maintain a blog post since the time of the Y2K and still maintain it to date with hundreds of posts.</description>
